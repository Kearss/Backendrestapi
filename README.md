# Backendrestapi
Projects idea is to test how rest api works and using mongobd to stora data. this allows me to understand how to connect a server with webapplication. 

Project uses mongodb to store and modify json files. in this project we creating links that provide a method of creating, modifying, removing and searching for the data on json file with postman testing tool.

in the project you can create a key value and store it in the json file which also gives the created item a id which you can modify it by searching the id and modifying it in postman software. this also works with deleting and searching for specific item.
